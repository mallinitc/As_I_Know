DOMAIN: Botanical research
• CONTEXT: University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of
plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have have invested on curating sample
images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a
photo
• DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: University’s management require an automation which can create a classifier capable of
determining a plant's species from a photo
Steps and tasks:
1. Import the data. Analyse the dimensions of the data. Visualise the data.
2. Design, train tune and test the best AIML image classifier model using:
• Supervised learning algorithms
• Neural networks
• CNN
3. Compare the results from the above step along with your detailed observations on the best performing algorithm and
why/how it outperforms other algorithms in this case.
4. Pickle the best performing model.
5. Import the the test image [ from the “ Prediction” folder ] to predict the class. Display the image. Use the best trained
image classifier model to predict the class.
