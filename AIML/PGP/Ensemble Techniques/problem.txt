DOMAIN: Telecom
• CONTEXT: A telecom company wants to use their historical customer data to predict behaviour to retain customers. You can
analyse all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.
• DATA DESCRIPTION: Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column
Metadata. The data set includes information about:
• Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
• Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device
protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
• Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly
charges, and total charges
• Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Build a model that will help to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability to churn.
This help the company to understand the pinpoints and patterns of customer churn and will increase the focus on strategising
customer retention.
• Steps to the project: [ Total score: 60 points ]
1. Import and warehouse data: [ Score: 5 point ]
• Import all the given datasets. Explore shape and size.
• Merge all datasets onto one and explore final shape and size.
2. Data cleansing: [ Score: 10 point ]
• Missing value treatment
• Convert categorical attributes to continuous using relevant functional knowledge
• Drop attribute/s if required using relevant functional knowledge
• Automate all the above steps
3. Data analysis & visualisation: [ Score: 10 point ]
• Perform detailed statistical analysis on the data.
• Perform a detailed univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis with appropriate detailed comments after each analysis.
4. Data pre-processing: [ Score: 5 point ]
• Segregate predictors vs target attributes
• Check for target balancing and fix it if found imbalanced.
• Perform train-test split.
• Check if the train and test data have similar statistical characteristics when compared with original data.
5. Model training, testing and tuning: [ Score: 25 point ]
• Train and test all ensemble models taught in the learning module.
• Suggestion: Use standard ensembles available. Also you can design your own ensemble technique using weak classifiers.
• Display the classification accuracies for train and test data.
• Apply all the possible tuning techniques to train the best model for the given data.
• Suggestion: Use all possible hyper parameter combinations to extract the best accuracies.
• Display and compare all the models designed with their train and test accuracies.
• Select the final best trained model along with your detailed comments for selecting this model.
• Pickle the selected model for future use.
6. Conclusion and improvisation: [ Score: 5 point ]
• Write your conclusion on the results.
• Detailed suggestions or improvements or on quality, quantity, variety, velocity, veracity etc. on the data points collected by the
telecom operator to perform a better data analysis in future
